# Python-Scrapy-Spider

Please build Scrapy spider extracting information from catalog.
Let's say that you'll have one day to do this (or 10 hours during few days). Here is the documentation of Scrapy, https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/examples.html
You have one day extra to read Scrapy documentation and try examples.
The catalogue http://dmoztools.net contains websites grouped by categories (or use any other catalogue you prefer)
Use .csv format for the output.
This Scrapy script should write to the output Category. Website name. Website URL. Extract the website title tag content if possible.
The number of the websites processed should be 150. I suggest to discuss the task after the first 10 websites would be processed.
